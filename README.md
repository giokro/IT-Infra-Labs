# IT-infrastructure-management 2019

This repository contains labs and final exam/coursework.
The final coursework allows us to make a fully functional and connected IT environment with just one command.
We used ansible for remote configuration of the machines.

We worked with several virtual servers and set up networking between the machines (DNS with bind9, haproxy), monitoring (with prometheus, influxdb, exporters like: node, bind, mysql, apache, so on); we, also, worked with docker containers of these services and visualized the data with grafana.

Naturally redundancy was also implemented for regular backups (lab 6).
